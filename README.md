# bible scraper forked from 
node-web-scraper
================

## I want to learn spanish but haven't been satisfied with courses I tried. I wrote this app which will scrape a book, courtesy of biblegateway.com, and alternately place each verse in english then spanish. I plan to read them out loud, record it, and place on youtube to play while I'm sleeping.
### The code is not meant to be polished, just to do the job I need it to do. I will go back an rename some variables, uniform the grammar/syntax/style to make the code more readable.
